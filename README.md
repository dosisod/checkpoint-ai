# checkpoint-ai
Checkpoint-based ML bruteforce algo

Using predefined checkpoints, let an algorithm find its way through each one

# Goal
This may have already been done, but with this specific implementation I hope to:

* Create my own basic ML implementation from the ground-up
* Share useful code that can be used by others
* Have an easy to maintain and use ML algo
